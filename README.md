# Rainfall Analysis in South East Queensland  
*Statistical Modelling Project – MXN500 (QUT)*

## 📘 Overview
This project performs an in-depth statistical analysis of long-term rainfall data from climate stations across South East Queensland. Using R, we applied data wrangling, visualization, and hypothesis testing to identify patterns in precipitation by weekday and location.

## 📊 Objectives
- Clean and filter BOM metadata to identify valid climate stations
- Isolate stations with >110 years of rainfall records in SEQ
- Perform exploratory data analysis and summary statistics
- Conduct a Chi-Square test to assess rainfall distribution across weekdays
- Visualize spatial station data using `ggmap`

## 🛠 Tools & Packages
- `R` and `R Markdown`
- `tidyverse` (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr)
- `ggmap` for geographic plotting
- `readr` and `lubridate` for data handling

## 📈 Key Features
- Interactive visualizations of climate station distribution
- Chi-square hypothesis testing on rainfall occurrence by weekday
- Filtering and mapping of stations based on metadata quality
- Clear statistical commentary and insights on regional rainfall trends

## 📁 Files Included
- `MXN500-Workbook-Part-4.Rmd`: Full R Markdown source file
- `report.pdf` *(optional)*: Compiled version of the report
- `README.md`: This documentation file
